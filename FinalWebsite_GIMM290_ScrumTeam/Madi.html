			<h1>My Bio :)</h1>
			<h2>Something I like to occasionally do during a session is to speak in tongues. It can be a nice touch of flavor to have one of the orcs the party is talking to turn to their comrade and whisper something in unintelligible orcish. Or to have an elf lord curse at them with silken invectives. Or have the strange, angelic being woken from an elder age quiz them in the stilted tones of a forgotten common tongue.

When I do this, of course, it’s not actually important that what I’m saying actually means anything. (If you actually know a fantasy tongue like Tolkien’s Quenya, that’s fantastic, but not required for this technique to be effective. And sprinkling in established words from a fantasy language as a sort of slang is a different thing, albeit also cool.) What is important is that the content flows, varies, and has a consistent tone. In other words, it needs to sound like someone actually speaking. Alright enough about making me sound cool. In reality I simply love to play video games, play with dogs, sketch, and make cosplay. So much so, that I plan to make a career out of my love of cosplay and gaming. I'm currentyl working my way through the dark depts of YouTube to become "Big and Famous". But, we all know the odds of that being fruitful, so I'm in school.</h2>
